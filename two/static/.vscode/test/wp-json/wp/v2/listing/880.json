Ah, good times.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only been here twice but both times were super fun. First, the Hubs had a birthday party here when they first opened. We didn&#8217;t rent it, we just gathered there with a bunch of friends. It was a blast! More recently, we took our three nephews here this summer and it was a hit. A great time was had by all!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":26548,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","listing-category":[88],"list-tags":[134,128,135,136],"location":[125],"cubewp_post_meta":[],"taxonomies":["Arts &amp; Entertainment","Accepts Credit cards","Arcades","Museums","Street Parking","Casino","Club","Pinball","Play","Seattle"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/listing\/880"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/listing"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/listing"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=880"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/26548"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=880"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"listing-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/listing-category?post=880"},{"taxonomy":"list-tags","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/list-tags?post=880"},{"taxonomy":"location","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/classic2.listingprowp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/location?post=880"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
